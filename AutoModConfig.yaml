        You've mentioned Docker, be sure to [generate a docker-compose](https://old.reddit.com/r/usenet/wiki/docker#wiki_get_docker-compose) of all your docker images in a pastebin and link to it. Most Docker issues can be solved by understanding the wiki article for [these automation software and Docker](https://old.reddit.com/r/usenet/wiki/docker), which is all about user, group, ownership, permissions and paths.

    Hi /u/{{author}} we weren't quite sure what type of post you were looking to make since you did not select a flair type.
    We went ahead and placed your post as an `unsolved` question. If this is not the case please make changes to correct this.
